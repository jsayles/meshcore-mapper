**Key Context:**
- This is a signal mapping app for wireless coverage
- Development environment fully configured on macOS
- Live reload working on Android tablet
- Project renamed from signal-mapper to meshcore-mapper during setup

**Next Steps:**
- Define app architecture and screen flow
- Implement signal strength measurement
- Add mapping/GPS functionality
- Design data storage strategy
